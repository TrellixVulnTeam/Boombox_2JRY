> This app is a simple music player with a set playlist. The "boombox" can skip, pause and play the musice from the library. I used the following languages for this project:

<p>React.js: structured code that is easy to understand and scalable</p>
<p>SCSS: all styles are in seperate files to make changes quickly and simply</p>

## Install

npm start
```
